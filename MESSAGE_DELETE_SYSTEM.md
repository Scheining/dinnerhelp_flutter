# DinnerHelp Message Delete System Documentation

**Last Updated:** January 5, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fully Implemented and Working

## Overview

The DinnerHelp app implements a Facebook/Airbnb-style message deletion system where messages are hidden from the user's view but preserved in the database and can reappear when new activity occurs.

## How It Works

### User Perspective
1. **Delete Action**: User swipes left on any message ‚Üí Taps "Slet" (Delete) button
2. **Message Disappears**: Message immediately vanishes from their Messages list
3. **Access Deleted**: User can view deleted messages via archive icon in app bar
4. **Auto-Restore**: If other party sends a new message, conversation reappears with full history

### Technical Implementation
- Messages are **never actually deleted** from the database
- Instead, they're marked as "hidden" for that specific user
- Each user has their own visibility settings independent of other users
- System automatically unhides conversations when new messages arrive

## Database Structure

### Table: `conversation_visibility`
Tracks which conversations are hidden for each user:

```sql
CREATE TABLE conversation_visibility (
  user_id UUID NOT NULL,
  conversation_id UUID NOT NULL,
  conversation_type TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'inquiry' or 'booking'
  hidden_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  last_hidden_message_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  PRIMARY KEY (user_id, conversation_id, conversation_type)
);
```

### Key Database Functions

#### `hide_conversation_for_user(conversation_id, conversation_type, user_id)`
- Hides a conversation for a specific user
- Records when it was hidden and the timestamp of the last message
- **NO RESTRICTIONS** - works for all conversations including active bookings

#### `auto_unhide_conversation(conversation_id, conversation_type, sender_id)`
- Automatically called when new messages arrive
- Unhides conversation for recipients (not the sender)
- Ensures conversations reappear with new activity

## Flutter Implementation

### UI Components

#### Swipe to Delete
**Location:** `lib/screens/notifications_screen.dart`
- Single swipe action: "Slet" (Delete)
- Red background, delete icon
- Calls `deleteConversation()` method

#### Deleted Messages View
**Location:** `lib/screens/archived_messages_screen.dart`
- Accessed via archive icon in Messages tab app bar
- Shows all deleted/hidden conversations
- Swipe to restore ("Gendan") functionality
- Empty state: "Ingen slettede beskeder"

### Provider Methods

**Location:** `lib/providers/messaging_provider.dart`

#### Core Methods:
1. **`deleteConversation()`** - Hides conversation for current user
2. **`getHiddenConversations()`** - Retrieves all hidden messages
3. **`unhideConversation()`** - Manually restores a conversation
4. **`_loadAllConversations()`** - Filters out hidden conversations from main list

### Filtering Logic
```dart
// Check if conversation is hidden
final hideKey = 'inquiry_${inquiry['id']}';
if (hiddenConversations.containsKey(hideKey)) {
  continue; // Skip this conversation
}
```

## User Experience Flow

### Deleting Messages
1. User sees unwanted conversation in Messages tab
2. Swipes left ‚Üí "Slet" button appears
3. Taps "Slet" ‚Üí Confirmation dialog
4. Confirms ‚Üí Message disappears
5. Success message: "Besked fjernet"

### Viewing Deleted Messages
1. Tap archive icon (üìÅ) in Messages tab app bar
2. See "Slettede beskeder" screen
3. View all deleted conversations
4. Can tap to read or swipe to restore

### Auto-Restore Behavior
1. User A deletes conversation with User B
2. User B sends new message
3. Conversation automatically reappears for User A
4. Full message history is visible

## Important Notes

### What "Delete" Actually Does
- **User thinks:** Message is deleted
- **Actually happens:** Message is hidden from their view only
- **Other party:** Unaffected, still sees conversation
- **Database:** All data preserved

### No Restrictions
- Can delete messages for **any** booking status
- Works for active, upcoming, completed bookings
- Works for inquiries and booking chats

### Privacy & Security
- Each user controls their own view
- Cannot affect other users' visibility
- Soft delete preserves audit trail
- Data never permanently removed

## Comparison with Old System

### Old Archive System (REMOVED)
- Had restrictions on active bookings
- Used `is_archived` field in database
- Function: `archive_booking_chat()` - NOT USED

### New Delete System (CURRENT)
- No restrictions on any bookings
- Uses `conversation_visibility` table
- Function: `hide_conversation_for_user()` - IN USE

## Testing the System

### Test Delete Function
1. Open Messages tab
2. Swipe left on any message
3. Tap "Slet" (Delete)
4. Verify message disappears

### Test Archive View
1. Delete a message (as above)
2. Tap archive icon in app bar
3. Verify deleted message appears in list
4. Swipe right ‚Üí Tap "Gendan" to restore

### Test Auto-Restore
1. Delete a conversation
2. Have other party send new message
3. Verify conversation reappears in main list

## Troubleshooting

### Message Not Disappearing After Delete
- Check if `hiddenConversations` map is populated
- Verify filtering logic in `_loadAllConversations()`
- Ensure `ref.invalidate()` is called after delete

### Archive Icon Not Showing
- Only appears in Messages tab (index 1)
- Check `_tabController.index == 1` condition
- Verify TabController listener for state updates

### Can't Restore Messages
- Check `unhideConversation()` method
- Verify deletion from `conversation_visibility` table
- Ensure provider refresh after restore

## Key Danish Translations

- **Delete** = Slet
- **Deleted messages** = Slettede beskeder  
- **No deleted messages** = Ingen slettede beskeder
- **Remove message** = Fjern besked
- **Message removed** = Besked fjernet
- **Restore** = Gendan
- **Message restored** = Besked gendannet

This implementation provides a user-friendly, Facebook-style deletion system that preserves data integrity while giving users control over their message visibility.
