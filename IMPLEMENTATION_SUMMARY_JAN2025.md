## 📱 REQUIRED FLUTTER APP UPDATES

### 1. Stripe Service Integration
The existing `StripeService` already has the `processRefund` method that can be used:
```dart
// In lib/services/stripe_service.dart
Future<bool> processRefund({
  required String bookingId,
  required int amount,
  required String reason,
}) 
```

### 2. UI Updates Needed

#### BookingScreen Changes:
```dart
// Show cancellation deadline
Text('Free cancellation until ${formatDate(cancellationDeadline)}')
```

#### BookingsScreen Changes:
```dart
// Show cancel button only if eligible
if (booking.cancellationDeadline.isAfter(DateTime.now())) {
  ElevatedButton(
    onPressed: () => _cancelBooking(booking),
    child: Text('Cancel Booking'),
  )
}
```

#### PaymentScreen Updates:
```dart
// Update messaging about immediate charge
Text('Payment will be processed immediately')
Text('Free cancellation up to 48 hours before service')
```

### 3. Cancellation Flow Implementation
```dart
Future<void> _cancelBooking(Booking booking) async {
  // Check if within cancellation window
  final hoursUntilService = booking.dateTime.difference(DateTime.now()).inHours;
  
  if (hoursUntilService > 48 || booking.cancelledBy == 'chef') {
    // Process refund
    final response = await supabase.functions.invoke(
      'refund-payment',
      body: {
        'booking_id': booking.id,
        'cancelled_by': 'user', // or 'chef'
        'reason': cancellationReason,
      },
    );
    
    // Show success message
    if (response.data['refunded']) {
      showSnackBar('Booking cancelled. Refund processing.');
    } else {
      showSnackBar('Booking cancelled. No refund due to policy.');
    }
  }
}
```

## 🔔 PUSH NOTIFICATIONS (Next Phase)

### Infrastructure Ready:
- Database tables created for FCM tokens
- Notification preferences in user profiles
- Placeholder in refund function for notifications

### Still Needed:
1. Create `send-push-notification` Edge Function
2. Integrate Firebase Cloud Messaging in Flutter app
3. Add notification triggers to booking flow

## 🧪 TESTING CHECKLIST

### Payment Flow Tests:
- [ ] Create booking with immediate payment capture
- [ ] Verify payment shows as 'succeeded' in Stripe Dashboard
- [ ] Confirm booking appears in database with correct status

### Refund Flow Tests:
- [ ] Cancel booking >48 hours before (should refund)
- [ ] Cancel booking <48 hours before (no refund)
- [ ] Chef cancels booking (always refunds)
- [ ] Verify refund appears in Stripe Dashboard
- [ ] Check refund_status in database updates correctly

### Edge Cases:
- [ ] Multiple cancellation attempts
- [ ] Refund after partial service
- [ ] Network failures during refund

---

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT STATUS

### Edge Functions:
- ✅ `create-payment-intent` v18 - DEPLOYED
- ✅ `refund-payment` v1 - DEPLOYED
- ✅ `stripe-webhook-db` - ACTIVE (no changes)

### Database Migrations:

## 📊 KEY BUSINESS LOGIC

### Payment Timeline:
1. **Booking Created**: Payment captured immediately
2. **48+ hours before**: Free cancellation with full refund
3. **<48 hours before**: No refund for user cancellation
4. **Chef cancellation**: Always full refund
5. **Service complete**: Chef receives payout (already implemented)

### Fee Structure (No Changes):
- User pays: Base + 25% VAT
- Platform keeps: 15% of base amount
- Chef receives: 85% of base amount

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

1. **NO BREAKING CHANGES**: All existing bookings continue to work
2. **BACKWARD COMPATIBLE**: Old payment flow still supported
3. **IMMEDIATE EFFECT**: New bookings use immediate capture
4. **REFUND TIMING**: Stripe refunds take 3-5 business days

---

## 📝 NEXT STEPS

1. **Immediate**: Test payment and refund flow in TestFlight
2. **This Week**: Update Flutter UI for cancellation policy
3. **Next Sprint**: Implement push notifications
4. **Future**: Add partial refund support
