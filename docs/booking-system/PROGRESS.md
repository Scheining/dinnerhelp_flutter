- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL
- **Payments**: Stripe Connect
- **Notifications**: Postmark (email) + OneSignal (push)
- **Architecture Pattern**: Clean Architecture

### Key Services

2. `RecurringBookingService` - Handles recurring patterns
3. `ChefScheduleService` - Chef availability management
4. `PaymentService` - Stripe integration
5. `NotificationService` - Email/push orchestration

## Risk Register

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Complex availability calculations | High | Extensive unit testing |
| Stripe Connect integration | Medium | Use existing web platform code |
| Recurring booking conflicts | High | Automated conflict detection |

## Notes
- Preserve existing navigation design
- No changes to current app theme
- Leverage existing Supabase setup
