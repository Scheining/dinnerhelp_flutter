## 🔧 Key Integration Components

### 1. Dependency Injection System
**File**: `lib/di/dependencies.dart`

- **Purpose**: Centralized dependency management following Clean Architecture
- **Features**:
  - Lazy singleton registration for all services
  - Proper dependency ordering (Core → Services → Repositories → Use Cases)
  - Easy cleanup with `disposeDependencies()`
  - Mock-friendly architecture for testing

**Key Functions**:
- `initializeDependencies()` - Initialize all app dependencies
- `_registerCoreServices()` - Register fundamental services (Supabase, HTTP, Storage)
- `_registerFeatureServices()` - Register business logic services
- `_registerRepositories()` - Register data access layer
- `_registerUseCases()` - Register application business rules

### 2. Navigation System
**File**: `lib/navigation/app_router.dart`

- **Purpose**: Type-safe navigation using GoRouter with deep linking support
- **Features**:
  - Shell routing with bottom navigation preservation
  - Deep linking for all booking flow screens
  - Proper parameter passing between screens
  - Error handling with custom error pages
  - Extension methods for easy navigation

**Key Routes**:
- `/` - Home screen with bottom navigation
- `/search/results` - Chef search results
- `/chef/:chefId` - Chef profile screen
- `/booking/dish-selection` - Dish selection screen
- `/booking/summary` - Booking summary screen
- `/booking/payment/:bookingId` - Payment processing
- `/booking/confirmation/:bookingId` - Booking confirmation

### 3. Main Application Updates
**File**: `lib/main.dart`

- **Changes**:
  - Added dependency injection initialization
  - Switched to `MaterialApp.router` for GoRouter support
  - Integrated router provider
  - Maintained existing theme and localization

### 4. Updated Dependencies
**File**: `pubspec.yaml`

- **Added**: `go_router: ^14.1.4` for navigation
- **Existing**: All booking system dependencies maintained

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Test Architecture
The testing suite follows a comprehensive approach with four main categories:

#### 1. Unit Tests
**Purpose**: Test individual components in isolation
- Service layer business logic
- Entity validation
- Use case implementations
- Repository contract compliance

**Example**: `booking_availability_service_test.dart`
- Tests time slot calculations
- Validates availability checks
- Handles edge cases and error conditions
- Mocks external dependencies

#### 2. Widget Tests
**Purpose**: Test UI components and user interactions
- Widget rendering and layout
- User input handling
- State management behavior
- Provider integration

**Example**: `booking_date_time_selector_test.dart`
- Date picker functionality
- Time slot selection
- Loading and error states
- Guest count modifications

#### 3. Integration Tests
**Purpose**: Test complete user flows end-to-end
- Full booking workflow
- Cross-screen navigation
- Data persistence
- Real-time updates

**Example**: `booking_flow_integration_test.dart`
- Complete booking from search to confirmation
- Payment processing flow
- Error handling scenarios
- Recurring booking setup

#### 4. Performance Tests
**Purpose**: Ensure app performs within acceptable limits
- Screen rendering times
- Memory usage monitoring
- Network request optimization
- Scrolling performance

**Example**: `booking_performance_test.dart`
- Screen load time < 1 second
- Memory usage under 50MB increase
- Search debouncing efficiency
- Payment processing under 5 seconds

### Test Utilities
**File**: `test/test_helpers/test_helpers.dart`

- **TestHelpers**: Environment setup and cleanup
- **DinnerHelpWidgetTester**: Custom widget testing utilities
- **TestDataFactory**: Mock data generation
- **CustomMatchers**: Domain-specific test matchers

### Test Runner
**File**: `test/test_runner.dart`

- **Features**:
  - Orchestrates all test suites
  - Provides detailed reporting
  - Generates coverage reports
  - Runs performance benchmarks
  - Manages test environment
