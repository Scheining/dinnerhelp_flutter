# DinnerHelp Payment & Refund System Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the complete payment, refund, and notification system for DinnerHelp, implemented on January 2025.

## Payment Flow

### 1. Immediate Payment Capture
When a user books a chef, payment is captured immediately (not just authorized). This ensures:
- No issues with 7-day authorization expiry for future bookings
- Platform has funds to handle refunds/disputes
- Industry-standard approach (like Airbnb)

### 2. Payment Distribution
- **User pays**: Full amount including 25% VAT
- **Platform keeps**: 15% service fee (calculated before VAT)
- **Chef receives**: Base amount minus platform fee (after service completion)

## Cancellation & Refund Policy

### Cancellation Rules
- **Free cancellation**: Up to 48 hours before service start time
- **No refund**: Less than 48 hours before service
- **Chef cancellation**: Always results in full refund regardless of timing

### Refund Process
1. User or chef initiates cancellation
2. System checks if within 48-hour window
3. If eligible, automatic refund is processed
4. User receives push notification and email confirmation
5. Funds returned to original payment method (3-5 business days)

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

#### Bookings Table Additions
```sql
-- Refund tracking fields
refund_status TEXT CHECK (refund_status IN ('none', 'pending', 'processed', 'failed'))
refunded_amount INTEGER DEFAULT 0
cancelled_by TEXT CHECK (cancelled_by IN ('user', 'chef', 'admin', 'system'))
cancellation_reason TEXT

-- Automatic cancellation deadline calculation
cancellation_deadline TIMESTAMPTZ GENERATED ALWAYS AS 
  (date + start_time - INTERVAL '48 hours') STORED
```

#### Push Notification Support
```sql
-- User push tokens table
CREATE TABLE user_push_tokens (
  id UUID DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  fcm_token TEXT NOT NULL,
  device_type TEXT CHECK (device_type IN ('ios', 'android')),
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(user_id, fcm_token)
);
```

### Edge Functions

#### create-payment-intent
- **Change**: Removed `capture_method: 'manual'`
- **Result**: Payments captured immediately
- **Location**: `/supabase/functions/create-payment-intent/`

#### refund-payment (NEW)
- **Purpose**: Process refunds for cancelled bookings
- **Validates**: 48-hour cancellation window
- **Location**: `/supabase/functions/refund-payment/`

#### send-push-notification (NEW)
- **Purpose**: Send push notifications via Firebase
- **Location**: `/supabase/functions/send-push-notification/`

### Webhook Handling

The existing `stripe-webhook-db` function handles:
- `payment_intent.succeeded` - Creates booking from reservation
- `charge.refunded` (NEW) - Updates booking refund status

## Push Notification Triggers

### For Users (Customers)
1. **Booking Accepted** - Chef confirms the booking
2. **Booking Cancelled by Chef** - Full refund initiated
3. **Refund Successful** - Confirmation of processed refund
4. **24-Hour Reminder** - Day before service
5. **Service Complete** - Request for review

### For Chefs
1. **New Booking Request** - Immediate notification
2. **User Cancellation** - Booking cancelled by customer
3. **Payment Received** - After service completion
4. **24-Hour Reminder** - Day before service

## API Changes

### StripeService
No changes needed - existing `processRefund` method will be used

### Flutter App Updates
1. **BookingScreen**: Show cancellation deadline
2. **BookingsScreen**: 
   - Show "Cancel" button only if within 48-hour window
   - Display cancellation policy clearly
3. **PaymentScreen**: Update messaging about immediate charge
